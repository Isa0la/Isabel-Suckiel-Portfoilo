                <p>Vins Plastics is a plastic packaging production company tailored for plastic solutions
                    for brands and consumers. The design work I create for Vins Plastics is mainly
                    in-house-related. I specialize in sale sheets, informational posters, monthly newsletters,
                    email signatures, and additional administrative-related projects. </p>
        
                    <p> Each design begins with keeping consistent use of typefaces, brand colours, and layouts
                    related to previous poster versions. The idea is to keep a similar concept throughout
                    the branding system to make it recognizable and approachable to all employees and
                    consumers of Vins Plastics. Each design created consists of three uniquely designed
                    drafts to start and expand to one finalized version. Each process of design consists
                    of multiple revisions and changes to make the perfect final design. </P>

                <p>Lotus Magazine showcases the house and garden lifestyle primarily focusing on flowers and plants for the home and garden. I was given a task to create a series of magazines that involved different creative executions for each cover and spine. I was also tasked to create full-page spreads to showcase content and numerical data. </p>
                    
                <p>The concept in mind when designing the final magazine series was to keep it sophisticated and clean while also making it legible for my target audience. I took inspiration from standard magazinesas I wanted to keep a boujee look and feel. I used a variety of creative characters to separate information to create more of a cohesive and elegant look. </P>

                <p>This poster focuses on recreating a brands look and feel. Pride has been a recurring event in Toronto since 1981 and current branding is minimal through its design choices on the website, promotional product, and advertisements. I was given a brief to create icons, patterns, a website, and a poster to promote the brand.</p>
                    
                <p>The approach to the project is to bring out the life of pride and showcase what its all about. My major focus within the designs is colour while also keeping it minimal to not overwhelm my targeted audience. The rainbow is a symbol of pride and I wanted this to be a focal point within my design through the use of vectors, lines, and patterns. </p>

                <p>This project targets Gen Z and my main focus within the design is to use elements to attract my audience and keep their attention. Ive done this through the use of colour, minimalism, and putting a good amount of focus on the facts at the bottom of the infographic. As well, the info must be legible in a clean and well-suited type. </p>

        <div class="beaver-content">
            <div class ="beaver-body">
                <p>The IMC campaign is a group student project promoting sunscreen products from The Green Beaver Company. The Big Idea is to convey the brands most important selling point: “higher standard in personal care with all natural products.” Our team showed this through happy subjects that radiate like the sun with the tagline of “Stay radiant like the sun, just without the UVs.” Mothers want the best for their children, thus it is usually when the first child is born that many women become more conscious about the ingredients that make up skin-care products. When children are happy, mothers are happy. </p>
        
                 <p> The creative recommendations included in the campaign include a walk-by billboard done by David Lindsay, a print poster done by Lisa Lee, a social media ad done by David Lu, and an interactive digital banner done by myself. </P>
